  <h1>Exploring SFPD Dispatch Data</h1>
    <p>The SFPD Dispatch dataset contains <b>emergency dispatch information</b> for 10,000 emergency calls from January 2018. This site highlights some findings from this dataset- full data analysis code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook linked above. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Let's start with the fundamental questions:

    <h2>Which <b>areas</b> had the <b>most emergencies? </b></h2>
        <p> → Here's a sorted bar plot of <b>frequency</b> by <b>zipcode:</b></p>
        <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/zip_counts.png' width="100%" height="100%"></div>
        <p> More on locational data can be found in Crime Correlation.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Which <b>times</b> of the day had the <b>most emergencies? </b></h2>
    <p> → Hours in the <b>late afternoon</b> and <b>evening</b> have the <b>most</b> emergencies (16 represents 4 PM):</p>
    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/hour_counts.png' width="80%" height="80%"></div>

    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>What is the <b>most common type</b> of emergency? </h2>
        <p> → <b>Medical incidents</b>, by a <b>long</b> shot.</p>
        <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/ct_counts.png' width="80%" height="80%"></div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h1>Trends</h1>
    <br>
    <div id="location"> <h1>1. The Effect of Location</h1></div>
    <h2>Which  <b>places</b> in SF take the  <b>longest</b> for emergency responders to reach?</h2>
    <p> Here we plot the median of the  <b>time difference between when the call is received </b> and <b>when the responders arrive on scene </b>of the incident, the "response time". Median is used here because it is <b>robust</b> to possible <b>outliers</b>.
    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/zipcode_response.png' width="100%" height="100%"></div>

  <h2 align="center">Highest Median Response Times By Zipcode</h2>
    <table align="center">
      <tr>
        <th>Zipcode</th>
        <th>First</th>
        <th>Second</th>
        <th>Third</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Zipcode: Median Response Time</td>
        <td>94129: 11.1 Minutes</td>
        <td>94134: 9.9 Minutes </td>
        <td>94127: 9.78 Minutes</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br>
   <p>  Outliers can be important though, so we'll do them next. <br>
     I was surprised to see that when I used  <b>means </b> instead of medians, I saw a  <b>very different plot: </b>: 

    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/zipcode_response_mean.png' width="100%" height="100%"></div>

    <h2 align="center">Highest Average (Mean) Response Times By Zipcode</h2>
    <table align="center">
      <tr>
        <th>Zipcode</th>
        <th>First</th>
        <th>Second</th>
        <th>Third</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Zipcode: Mean Response Time</td>
        <td>94127: 45.32 Minutes</td>
        <td>94105: 19.02 Minutes </td>
        <td>94129: 15.55 Minutes</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>

    <p><b> What's going on zipcode 94127? </b> It seems to have an  <b>absurdly high response time </b> on average- its population is just 20,624, so it's definitely not overcrowded. It's also the wealthiest zipcode in our study, with a median household income of $95,313, which makes this even stranger. <br>
    Let's take a look at a terrain map of San Francisco - zipcode 94127 is highlighted in red:
    <br> 
    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/terrain.png' width="50%" height="50%"></div>
    <br>
    <p> It turns out that <b>94127</b> is <b>almost completely enclosed by mountainous terrain</b>, and contains some itself. This definitely adds <b>complexity</b> in <b>physically reaching</b> emergencies in 94127- more mountainous land can mean more detours, more roundabout roads, and <b>on average a longer and slower-speed trip than a flatter region</b>. This can help explain why we see a lot of extremely high response time outliers when considering this zipcode, which explains the <b>vast difference</b> between the mean, which is sensitive to outliers, and the median. 
    <br> <br> 

    For the other zipcodes whose means differed,<b> 94104, 94108, 94111, and 94133</b> officially make up SF's crowded <b>Financial District</b>, home to the city's <b>largest concentration </b> of corporate headquarters, firms and financial institutions. <b>94105</b> and <b>94111</b> are in crowded downtown San Francisco, at or near the Financial District. For these zipcodes, high amounts of <b>traffic</b> can possibly be <b>impacting response time</b>, increasing the variance and mean. 


    <div id="time"> <h1>2. The Effect of Time of Day</h1></div>
    <h2>Which <b>times</b> of the day are emergency responders <b>slower to react</b> to dispatch alerts? </h2>
    <p> → Emergency responders had the <b>lowest expected delay</b> in marking themselves <b>"en route"</b> for emergency dispatches during <b>evening</b>, and naturally seemed to have the <b>most lag during night hours</b>. <br> Here's the distribution of the <b>time difference</b> between the moment the operator dispatches the unit and when the unit reports that it is en route, for these two chunks of the day. 
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/time_dist.png' width="90%" height="90%"></div>
    <br>
    <p> → The distribution suggests late night hours <b>(12 AM to 7 AM)</b> have greater density towards the higher times, indicating <b>slower response overall</b>. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Two measures of central tendency, the <b>mean</b> and the <b>median</b> (used because it is robust to outliers), are shown below:</p>
    <h2 align="center">Average Time to Respond to Dispatch Alert for Portions of Day</h2>
    <table align="center">
      <tr>
        <th>Portion of Day</th>
        <th>Mean Time to Respond</th>
        <th>Median Time to Respond</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Morning to Late Afternoon (8 AM to 3 PM)</td>
        <td>1.25 min</td>
        <td>0.70 min</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Evening Hours (4 PM to 11 PM)</td>
        <td>0.94 min</td>
        <td>0.83 min</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Night Hours (12 AM to 7 AM)</td>
        <td>1.41 min</td>
        <td>1.23 min</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p>Plotting this time difference by <b>specific hour</b>, it makes it clear that <b>night hours are hardest</b> on emergency responders (this is 24 hr time- 0 is midnight, 4 represents 4 AM, 5 is 5 AM, etc.): </p>

  <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/hour_response.png' width="90%" height="90%"></div>


  <div id="income"><h1>3. The Effect of Income</h1></div>
  <h2>How does the <b>response</b> and <b>arrival time</b> differ for <b>wealthier</b> and <b>poorer</b> areas?</h2>

  <p> To answer this, we consult outside data on <b>median household incomes</b> for SF zipcodes. We can categorize each by quartile of annual household income. 
    <br>
    → We find that emergency responders in SF actually take <b>longer</b> to both <b>react to dispatches</b> to <b>wealthier</b> zipcodes and to <b>arrive on scene to their emergencies</b>. This was surprising, especially after reading studies such as <b><a href = "http://www.naemsp.org/Documents/2017%20Annual%20Meeting%20Handouts/3%20THURS%20Presentation7.pdf">this</a></b> and <b><a href = "https://www.bridgemi.com/detroit-journalism-cooperative/detroit-police-improve-response-times-not-all-neighborhoods-are-equal">this</a></b>.
    <br>
    <p>Here's the <b>median time</b> (robust to outliers) needed for responders to declare that they're <b>en route</b> to the emergency, by <b>income quartile</b>:</p>
    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/incomebands2.png' width="60%" height="60%"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Here's the <b>median time</b> needed for responders to <b>arrive on scene</b> to the emergency:</p>
