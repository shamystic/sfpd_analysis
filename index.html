  <h1>Exploring SFPD Dispatch Data</h1>
    <p>The SFPD Dispatch dataset contains dispatch information for 10,000 emergency calls, with call and arrival times, call types, location, and dispositions from January 2018. This website serves to highlight some findings from this dataset- full data analysis code can be found in the Jupyter Notebook linked above. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Let's start with the fundamental questions:

    <h2>Which areas had the most emergencies? </h2>
        <p> → Here's a sorted bar plot of frequency by zipcode:</p>
        <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/zips_freq.png' width="70%" height="70%"></div>
        <p> More on locational data can be found in Crime Correlation.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Which times of the day had the most emergencies? </h2>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>What is the most common type of emergency? </h2>
        <p> → Medical incidents, by a long shot.</p>
        <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/call_types.png' width="70%" height="70%"></div>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h1>Trends</h1>
    <br>
    <div id="location"> <h1>1. The Effect of Location</h1></div>
    <h2>Which places in SF take the longest for emergency responders to reach?</h2>
    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/sa_response.png' width="100%" height="100%"></div>


    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/zipcode_response.png' width="100%" height="100%"></div>

    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/battalion_response.png' width="100%" height="100%"></div>



    <div id="time"> <h1>2. The Effect of Time of Day</h1></div>
    <h2>Which times of the day are emergency responders slower to react to dispatch alerts? </h2>
    <p> → Emergency responders had the lowest expected delay in marking themselves "en route" for emergency dispatches during evening, and naturally seemed to have the most lag during night hours. <br> Here's the distribution of the time difference between the moment the operator dispatches the unit and when the unit reports that it is en route, for these two chunks of the day. 
    <br>
    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/time_dist.png' width="90%" height="90%"></div>
    <br>
    <p> → The distribution suggests late night hours (12 AM to 7 AM) have greater density towards the higher times, indicating slower response overall. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Two measures of central tendency, the mean and the median (used because it is robust to outliers), are shown below:</p>
    <h2 align="center">Average Time to Respond to Dispatch Alert for Portions of Day</h2>
    <table align="center">
      <tr>
        <th>Portion of Day</th>
        <th>Mean Time to Respond</th>
        <th>Median Time to Respond</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Morning to Late Afternoon (8 AM to 3 PM)</td>
        <td>1.25 min</td>
        <td>0.70 min</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Evening Hours (4 PM to 11 PM)</td>
        <td>0.94 min</td>
        <td>0.83 min</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Night Hours (12 AM to 7 AM)</td>
        <td>1.41 min</td>
        <td>1.23 min</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <br>
    <p>What about specific hours? </p>

  <div id="income"><h1>3. The Effect of Income</h1></div>
  <h2>How is the response and travel time for wealthier and poorer areas?</h2>

  <p> To answer this, we consult outside data on median household incomes for SF zipcodes.
    <br>
    → Emergency responders in SF actually take longer to both respond to dispatches to wealthier districts and to get on scene to their emergencies. This was surprising, especially after reading studies such as <a href = "http://www.naemsp.org/Documents/2017%20Annual%20Meeting%20Handouts/3%20THURS%20Presentation7.pdf">this</a> and <a href = "https://www.bridgemi.com/detroit-journalism-cooperative/detroit-police-improve-response-times-not-all-neighborhoods-are-equal">this</a>.
    We plot medians here as it is robust to outliers; means are displayed in the table.
    <br>
    <p>Here's the median time needed for responders to declare that they're on route to the emergency, by income quartile:</p>
    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/incomebands2.png' width="90%" height="90%"></div>
    <br>
    <p>Here's the median time needed for responders to arrive on scene to the emergency:</p>
    <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/incomebands.png' width="90%" height="90%"></div>
