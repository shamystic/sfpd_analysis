         <br>
         <p>Dispatch time is the <b>difference</b> in minutes between when the <b>call was received</b>, and when the responders <b>arrive on scene</b>.
            <br>
            <b>Means</b> were used to compute averages; for completeness medians and means were plotted below for each location type, as they can lead to different answers- mean is particularly <b>sensitive to outliers</b>, which are very much present.</p>
          <br><br>
         <h2 align="center">How can this be <b>reduced?</b></h2>
         <p>
         <h2>1. Route optimization and shortcuts, especially for urban and tough terrain areas.</h2>
         <p>We saw earlier that some of the hardest to reach areas are highly <b>urbanized and concentrated</b>, such as the <b>Financial District</b> and Downtown. Factors such as crowdiness and traffic are <b>outside of the control </b>of emergency responders, but work can be put into find possible driving <b>shortcuts</b> to destinations in the highly urban districts, as they are often the most troubled- For example, zipcode 94102 had the <b>most</b> emergency calls, and 94105 endured one of the <b>slowest average response times</b>- both are in <b>downtown</b> SF.
            <br> → It is <b>crucial</b> to know the best way around <b>tough terrain</b>. The top three hardest <b>boxes</b> to reach, <b>8611</b> (Twin Peaks area), <b>6344</b> (John McLaren Park area) and <b>6664</b> (Hunter's Point) are <b>all inside or surrounded</b> by <b>mountainous </b>terrain, so it's definitely having an <b>impact</b>. If possible, detours and shortcuts to <b>avoid slow-speed passages</b> or <b>roundabouts</b> are <b>essential</b> to know of <b>beforehand</b>. 
         </p>

         <h2>2. Enhanced marshalling of night responders.</h2>
         <p>From the <b><a href="/sfpd_analysis/index#time"></b>Trend of Time of Day</a></b>, we saw that <b>late night responders </b>take a <b>longer</b> time to <b>respond to a dispatch notice</b> than their daylight counterparts. While this is only natural, <b>better strategies</b> to ensure that night responders are <b>well-rested and prepared</b> for their night shift can <b>help reduce dispatch times</b>.
         <div align="center"><img src='assets/box.png' width="60%" height="60%"></div>

         <h2>3. Increasing awareness of <b>alternate</b> emergency services.</h2>
         <p> I noticed that <b>Presidio</b>, the city with the <b>slowest average response time</b> (with zipcode <b>94129</b>, the <b>slowest</b> median response time of <b>any zipcode</b>), is a <b>unique</b> location as it is actually a designated <b>National Park</b>, with many natural, wooded areas, hills, and greenery:
         <div align="center"><img src='assets/Presidio.PNG' width="50%" height="50%"></div>
         <br>
         <p> Why is it that SFPD takes <b>so long</b> to get there?
            <br> It turns out that Presidio actually maintains its <b>own emergency service</b> system, <b>separate from typical SFPD</b>- it is served by the <b>United States Park Police</b> due to its status as a <b>national park</b> site, and the San Francisco Fire Department (SFFD). As such, it actually maintains its<b> own emergency call hotline</b>, and indicates the following on their <a href="https://www.presidio.gov/presidio-trust/about/emergency-services">website</a>:
         <div align="center"><img src='assets/p_hotline1.PNG' width="50%" height="50%"></div>
         <div align="center"><img src='assets/p_hotline2.PNG' width="70%" height="70%"></div>
         <br>
         <p>A possible cause for <b>extremely high response times</b> to Presidio is that people in emergencies are <b>not calling </b>the <a href="https://www.nps.gov/prsf/learn/historyculture/fire-station.htm">Presidio specific service</a> and <b>instead</b> are calling <b>911</b> by <b>cell</b> phone, <b>directing their calls</b> to regular SFPD dispatch centers <b>outside Presidio</b>- a very natural and wooded region that is probably hard to navigate from the outside, especially by those unfamiliar with it, <b>like non-Presidio police</b>.
            <br> → So <b>increasing awareness</b> of the <b>separate number</b> for emergency services <b>directly serving</b> Presidio and </b>similarly unique regions</b> with their own dispatch services would most likely <b> help reduce </b> the high response time and <b>increase efficiency</b> of emergency handling overall.
