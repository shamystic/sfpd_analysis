  <h1>Preparing for the Future</h1>
  <h2>Which areas are experiencing the greatest increase in dispatch calls?</h2>

  <p> The dataset spans from January 13th to January 24th, and thus it's difficult to measure change in number of calls over this small time period, especially as we can see that the areas with the most calls consistently dominate the top of the charts. For example, zipcodes 94102, 94103 and 94109 had the most emergency calls on January 13th, the earliest day in the data, and also had the most on January 24th, the last included in the dataset. <br><br>
  We can, however, look into these frequencies to understand what the most common issues are.

 <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/sa.png' width="100%" height="100%"></div>

<p> 1. Medical emergencies are the issue the overwhelming majority of the time, and its proportion is much greater than the subsequent emergencies. 
<p> 2. Medical emergencies are followed by structure fires, alarms, and trafic collisions; their order can vary by area. Together, medical emergencies, fires (outside and structural), alarms, and traffic collisions account for more than 94% of the emergency calls in January. Hence, these are the emergencies we should focus our analysis on.

<h2>Where and what type of dispatch service would help with the rate of increasing calls?</h2>

<h3>The elephant in the room- medical incidents</h3>
<p> Emergency medical responders should always wary of highly urban areas, as the following medical emergency heatmap shows: <br>
<img src="assets/medical_heat.PNG" alt="SFPD calls Heatmap" width="70%" height="70%"><br>

<p>They should especially focus on Mid Market and the Civic Center, which have an especially high concentration of medical emergencies, highlighted by the red in this heatmap. These are the side-by-side zipcodes 94102 and 94103, which together accounted for 27% of all medical emergency calls in the month of January. Including the nearby 94109 and 94110 raises this to 43% of all medical incidents. Thus, I would set up a medical dispatch services specific to these zipcodes to better cater the high proportion of medical incidents. It is also to ensure all units in this zipcodes contain ALS (advanced life support) resources and paramedics, as for every single one of these four districts, medical emergencies reprsent at least 70% of all emergencies. </p>

<p>These four zipcodes - 94102, 94103, 94109, and 94110 account for 37% of all alarms in San Francisco, and a heatmap shows the high concentration of alarms in 94102 (which had both the most medical incidents and the most alarms, with 94103 having the second most in both cases.)

<p> Emergency responders should also expect most fires- even outside ones- to come from urban areas, as symbol maps of fires indicate: <br>
      <h3>All Fires</h3>

      <h3>Outside Fires</h3>

      <p>A heatmap of traffic collisions highlights some specific areas that can be monitored, such as the intersection of Highway 101 and Silver Avenue, several areas on 7th Street and the South of Market.
