  <h1>Preparing for the Future</h1>
  <h2>Which areas are experiencing the greatest increase in dispatch calls?</h2>

  <p> The dataset spans from January 13th to January 24th, and thus it's <b>difficult</b> to measure change in number of calls over this small time period, especially as we can see that the areas with the most calls consistently dominate the top of the charts.<br><br>For example, zipcodes <b>94102, 94103 and 94109 </b> had the most emergency calls on January 13th, the earliest day in the data, and <b>also had the most</b> on January 24th, the last day included in the dataset. <br><br>
  We can, however, <b>look into these frequencies</b> to understand what the most common issues are. 

 <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/zip_counts.png' width="90%" height="90%"></div>
 <div align="center"><img src = 'assets/sa.png' width="80%" height="80%"></div>

<p> 1. <b>Medical emergencies</b> are the issue the overwhelming <b>majority</b> of the time, and its proportion is much greater than the subsequent emergencies. 
<p> 2. For any given region, medical emergencies are most prominent and almost always followed by <b>structure fires, alarms, and traffic collisions</b>; their order can vary by area. Together, medical emergencies, fires (outside and structural), alarms, and traffic collisions account for more than <b>94%</b> of all emergency calls in January. Hence, these are the emergencies we should <b>focus</b> our analysis on: 

<div align="center"><img src = 'assets/ct_counts.png' width="70%" height="70%"></div>

<h2>Where and what type of dispatch service would help with the rate of increasing calls?</h2>

<h3>The <b>elephant</b> in the room - <b>medical incidents</b></h3>
<p> Emergency medical responders should always wary of highly <b>urban</b> areas, as the following medical emergency heatmap shows: <br>
<div align="center"><img src="assets/medical_heat.PNG" alt="SFPD calls Heatmap" width="50%" height="50%"><br></div> <br>

<p>They should especially focus on <b>Mid Market</b> and the <b>Civic Center</b>, which have an especially high concentration of medical emergencies. These are contained in the area circled below. <br>
 <div align="center"><img src="assets/midmarket.PNG" alt="SFPD calls Heatmap" width="70%" height="70%"><br></div> <br>

<p><br>These areas are within the two side-by-side zipcodes <b>94102</b> and <b>94103</b>, that together accounted for <b>27%</b> of all medical emergency calls in the month of January. Including the nearby <b>94109</b> and <b>94110</b> raises this to <b>43%</b> of all medical incidents. <br>
<br>→ Thus, I would set up a <b>medical dispatch service</b> specific to these zipcodes to better cater the <b>high proportion of medical incidents</b>. It is very much imperative to ensure that <b>all units dispatched</b> in these zipcodes contain <b>ALS</b> (advanced life support) resources and <b>paramedics</b>, as for <b>every single</b> one of these four districts, medical emergencies represent <b>at least 70%</b> of all emergencies if not more. </p>

<p>These four zipcodes - <b>94102, 94103, 94109, and 94110</b> also account for <b>37%</b> of <b>all alarms</b> in San Francisco, and this heatmap shows the high concentration of alarms in 94102 (which had both the <b>most</b> medical incidents and the most alarms, with <b>94103</b> having the <b>second most</b> in both cases.) <br>

        <div align="center"><img src="assets/alarms_future.PNG" alt="SFPD calls Heatmap" width="60%" height="60%"></div><br>


<p> Emergency responders should also expect <b>most fires-</b> even outside ones- to come from urban areas, as symbol maps of fires indicate. Zipcode <b>94102</b> had the most structure fires in the month of January, representing almost <b>19%</b> of all fire calls. <b>94103</b> again shows up having the third highest, with 8.3%. <b>Special fire dispatch</b> services for this area would thus be useful.<br>
      <h3 align="center"> All Fires</h3>
      <div align="center"><img src="assets/call_final_fire.PNG" alt="SFPD calls Heatmap" width="50%" height="50%"></div>
      <h3 align="center">Outside Fires</h3>
      <div align="center"><img src="assets/outside_fires.png" alt="SFPD calls Heatmap" width="50%" height="50%"><br></div><br>
      <p>A heatmap of <b>traffic collisions</b> highlights some specific areas that responders should be wary of, such as the <b>intersection of Highway 101</b> and <b>Silver Avenue</b>, and several areas on <b>7th Street</b> and the <b>South of Market</b>. 
      <div align="center"><img src="assets/traffic_collisions.PNG" alt="SFPD calls Heatmap" width="50%" height="50%"><br></div><br>

      <p>It's now <b>clear</b> that <b>these four zipcodes- <b>94102, 94103, 94109, and 94110</b>- require special attention</b>. If I could specify locations of dispatch services freely, I'd want to allow emergency responders to <b>cater efficiently</b> to the <b>high likelihood</b> of emergencies in <b>94102</b> and <b>94103</b>, as well as <b>94109</b> and <b>94110</b>, and be sure that these services are <b>always equipped</b> for medical emergencies with ALS and paramedics, fires, and alarms- the most prominent cases. <br>
      → With all this in mind, here are three dispatch services I would place, located <b>in between</b> these specific zipcodes for <b>maximum range</b> (marked in <b>blue</b>):

      <div align="center"><img src="assets/my_points.png" alt="SFPD calls Heatmap" width="70%" height="70%"><br></div>
      <br>

      <h3>On Trains...</h3>
      <p>→ <b>All 55</b> Train and Rail incidents occured in Station Area <b>13</b>, zipcodes 94105 and 94111, so dispatchers there should be <b>specifically </b>ready for this type of emergency.
